# Origins-E-Sport Project

Origins-E-Sport is an OTT (Over The Top) platform project for hosting e-sport videos.

Based on a freemium model, the single-page application allows visitors to watch streaming content for free but with restricted access. Creating a user account or subscribing to a premium plan unlocks additional videos and features.

A back-office space secured through an authentication system allows an administrator to fully manage the online content and monitor activity on the platform.

This project was developed as part of the Web & Mobile developer certification at the WildCodeSchool.
